`DigitalPaymentEnablementController`


# Mpay V1 Tokens Ref Put

Generates a DPAN and stores the relationship between the Reference ID, DPAN and the real PAN. This method is called during the customer registration process, ahead of any payment. The Reference ID is an identifier chosen by the client system for mobile payment registration. It must be unique in context of the client system, and is the key to obtaining and managing the payment details later.
