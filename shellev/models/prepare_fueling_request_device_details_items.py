        device_id (str): This is the mobile device’s unique ID (Vendor ID for
            iOS vs. Android ID for Android). This is only used for
            transactions made via the Shell Mobile App and will therefore be
            mandatory for requests originating from Shell’s mobile app but can
            be ignored by all other parties.
        model (str): This is the mobile device’s model (machine
            name/systemInfo for iOS vs. Build.MODEL for Android).  This is
            only used for transactions made via the Shell Mobile App and will
            therefore be mandatory for requests originating from Shell’s
            mobile app but can be ignored by all other parties.
        os_version (str): This is the mobile device’s OS Version. This is only

            mobile app but can be ignored by all other parties.

            made via Android versions of the Shell Mobile App and will

            Android mobile app but can be ignored by all other devices and/or
            parties. This field is used to capture the Shell App build that
            was used to make this call.
